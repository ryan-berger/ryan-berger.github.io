      <description>&lt;p&gt;Monday night at 4pm I was spending time with my girlfriend for the last few moments of her trip
when I received a phone call from a &amp;ldquo;Private Number&amp;rdquo;. She was about to head to the airport when I
got wide-eyed and said I needed to answer a call. I knew this was likely to be a call
informing me that a pair of lungs had been found for me, and I was right. The Coordinator told me
it wasn&amp;rsquo;t for sure, and that by 8pm they would have a decision on whether the lungs were
for me. At 7pm I had a call with them confirming that this was the case.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special thanks to @tombh for proofing this blog post!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit 5/28: added a link to the repo and corrected the solver I used&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that LinkedIn has games? I sure as hell didn&amp;rsquo;t until my Dad
showed me that they in fact have 5 (!) different games that you can play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of them stood out to me as somewhat interesting, Queens:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Programming at a Cafe at the End of the Universe</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello! My name is Ryan Berger, I&amp;rsquo;m a 24-year-old software developer living in Seattle, WA. This is the first real post
of my blog, and oh boy is it a doozy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To cut it short: in the coming months, I will be undergoing a bilateral lung transplant at the University of Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have—since I was 13—known this was coming, but my lung function and blood tests show that I am not too far off
from respiratory failure. My doctors have determined that I am in good shape and it is now time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
