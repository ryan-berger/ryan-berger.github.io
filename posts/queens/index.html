about reducing N-Queens to SAT that was quite helpful and showed where my approach was failing.</p><p>Instead of going cell, by cell, it is a bit easier to model the problem row-by-row, column-by-column,

case that there be &ldquo;at most one.&rdquo; What are we missing? &ldquo;At least one.&rdquo; If we have &ldquo;at least one&rdquo; and &ldquo;at most one,&rdquo;
then we end up with &ldquo;exactly one.&rdquo; &ldquo;At least one&rdquo; is also very easy! It is just an or (\(\lor\)) of all the cells.</p><p>With this knowledge we can build a helper function \(exactlyOne\) and use it for each row and column:
$$
exactlyOne(\{&mldr;\}) = atMostOne(\{&mldr;\}) \wedge atLeastOne(\{&mldr;\})
$$</p><p>Where \(atLeastOne\) is all the elements (in the row, or column) or&rsquo;ed \(\lor\), but \(atMostOne\) is a bit more complicated:</p><p>$$
atMostOne(terms) = \bigwedge\limits_{i=0}^{N-1} (terms_{i} \implies (\bigwedge\limits_{j=i+1}^N \neg terms_{j}))
$$</p><p>or if you&rsquo;re not a programmer who thinks about \(\bigwedge\) like a loop:
$$
atMostOne(terms) = \bigwedge\limits_{0 \leq i&lt;j \leq n} terms_i \implies \neg terms_j
$$</p><p>For each item in \(terms\), it is implied that it is <em>not</em> any of the following terms.</p><h3 id=an-aside>An Aside<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#an-aside>#</a></h3><p>This initially confused me as my first idea was that &ldquo;given a cell, it implies all the cells in its group (row, column) are
false&rdquo;. This would require the inner \(\bigwedge\) to be bounded via \(j=0, j\neq i\) so that it gets all the other items of the group.
You can get a good feel for why the above is more optimal though if you write it out when \(n=2\):
$$
(term_i \implies (\neg term_{i+1})) \land (term_{i+1} \implies (\neg term_i))
$$</p><p>Oops! The right-hand side of the \(\land\) is just the contrapositive, so you&rsquo;re and&rsquo;ing (\(\land\)) a duplicate condition.
A better way of seeing it is when you use a logical interpretation such as in the <a href=https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~johnsojr/2017-18/fall/CS270/Lectures/8/sat.pdf>N-Queens Lecture</a>.</p><p>There, the multiple contrapositives will show up as duplicate pairs of \(\lor\)s that look like:
$$
(\neg term_i \lor \neg term_j) \land (\neg term_j \lor \neg term_i)
$$</p><p>Which is why the inner loop&rsquo;s bound starts at the next item in the list, as to not duplicate the effort
of the previous iteration by generating duplicate pairs.</p><h3 id=back-to-it>Back to It<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#back-to-it>#</a></h3><p>This helpful function can aid us in formulating the constraints for rows and columns since it is guaranteed
that a queen must be on every row and every column. However, it is not guaranteed that every diagonal
must have a queen, just that two queens should not share a diagonal.</p><p>For example:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>. . Q X
Q . X .
. X . Q
X Q . .
</code></pre><p>Notice that the diagonal denoted with X&rsquo;s does not have a queen. This is a gotcha we&rsquo;ll
see in a moment, but the easy way to solve this with another existing function we have is the \(atMostOne\) constraint.
It is true that there must only be \(atMostOne\) queen per diagonal.</p><p>Now that we have all the building blocks, we can build the final formula:
$$
rowConstraint = \bigwedge\limits_{i=0}^N exactlyOne(row_{i}) \newline
columnConstraint = \bigwedge\limits_{i=0}^N exactlyOne(column_{i}) \newline
diagonalConstraint = \bigwedge\limits_{i=0}^{numDiagonal} atMostOne(diagonal_{i}) \newline
NQueens = rowConstraint \wedge columnConstraint \wedge diagonalConstraint
$$</p><h2 id=queens>Queens<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#queens>#</a></h2><p>So, now that we&rsquo;ve solved N-Queens, LinkedIn&rsquo;s Queens should be very similar, but the approach needs to be adapted
to the new rules. The rules for this version is as follows:</p><ul><li>There must be one queen per row</li><li>There must be one queen per column</li><li>There must be one queen per color</li><li>No queen can be adjacent to another</li></ul><p>So we&rsquo;ve added the constraint of color but dropped the constraint that the queens couldn&rsquo;t be on the same
diagonal. The only diagonal that we&rsquo;re worried about is the one that is directly adjacent.</p><p>Armed with our helper of \(exactlyOne\) in hand, we can start to get a foothold on the problem:
$$
rowConstraint = \bigwedge\limits_{i=0}^N exactlyOne(row_{i}) \newline
columnConstraint = \bigwedge\limits_{i=0}^N exactlyOne(column_{i}) \newline
colorConstraint = \bigwedge\limits_{i=0}^{numColors} exactlyOne(colors_{i}) \newline
$$</p><p>Now all we have left is to deal with adjacency. What is adjacency? In Queen&rsquo;s context we can&rsquo;t have a queen
placed on the same color, nor can they be placed on the same row or column. What does that leave us with?</p><p>Well, it only leaves us with the <em>adjacent diagonal</em> of every cell that borders a different color. I will call this an &ldquo;edge&rdquo;
For example:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>X X . .
X Y . .
. . . .
. . . .
</code></pre><p>In this case, the only adjacency we&rsquo;d be worried about with colors X and Y is the diagonally adjacent (0, 0) -> (1,1).
Since the number of edges with such a diagonal is small, we can just iterate over every cell on the board,
look at its diagonal neighbors, and if they <em>aren&rsquo;t</em> the same color then we will add them to a set for the cell.</p><p>The pseudo-code would be something like:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span style=display:flex><span>Pair <span style=color:#f92672>=</span> Tuple[int, int]

</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>    <span style=color:#66d9ef>return</span> result
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now that we have a dictionary full of edges which correspond to their &ldquo;adjacent&rdquo; neighbors,
we need to figure out how to constrain them.</p><p>Without much thinking, I initially pulled out \(exactlyOne\). However, in doing so, you make it so that
the solution <em>must</em> contain a queen in one of the spots that have an adjacency. This will work for a very small subset
of Queens games (which I found out the hard way).</p><p>Instead, like diagonals in N-Queens, we just need to make sure that there is \(atMostOne\) item in the adjacent grouping.</p><p>Because I&rsquo;m lazy, the above code isn&rsquo;t particularly careful about generating duplicate \(atMostOne\) constraints.
Using the previous example, both <code>(0, 0) -> {(1,1)}</code> and <code>(1,1) -> {(0,0)}</code> would be in <code>result</code>, meaning that
an implication will get generated both ways.</p><p>Since SAT solvers are super smart about this sort of thing, it isn&rsquo;t hindering anything, but is left as an exercise
for the reader to actually optimize this.</p><p>Now that we have all the pieces, lets formalize it:
$$
&mldr;\newline
adjacentConstraint = \bigwedge\limits_{i=0}^{numAdjacent} atLeastOne(adjacent_i) \newline
Queens = rowConstraint \wedge columnConstraint \wedge \newline
colorConstraint \wedge adjacentConstraint
$$</p><h2 id=going-for-gold>Going for Gold<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#going-for-gold>#</a></h2><p>After proving to myself that this worked via manually inputting Queens games, it was time to put it to the test:
getting the world record on LinkedIn&rsquo;s Queens. SAT solvers are slow in the worst case, but it turns out that
most problems aren&rsquo;t the worst case and CVC5 solves this blazingly fast.</p><p>It took some work to get a Firefox extension up and running with a small <a href=https://github.com/ryan-berger/queens/blob/master/main.py>Python API</a> to ferry the puzzle/solution to
and from CVC5 (wish I could say it was using Z3-wasm, but I had many <a href=https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/issues/7556>issues</a>), and I had it working.</p><p>And I&rsquo;m proud to report, that it did it 🎉</p><p>I have become the conduit through which CVC5 has proven itself smarter than 99% of CEOs and 99% of my fellow
